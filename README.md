# Windows11_on_unsupported_hardware
This project has been created so people that have older computers can run the new Windows 11 smoothly.

This is Version 1 of "W11_On_Unsupported_Hardware"

When you download this compressed file, extract it. Once you have extracted, delete this readme file or make sure it's not in the same folder where the rest of the files are.
Next, you want to turn this file into a .iso image. I recommend using Folder2Iso (You can get it using this link) -> https://www.trustfm.net/software/utilities/Folder2Iso.php?page=Download
Need help using it? Here is a guide -> https://www.trustfm.net/software/utilities/Folder2Iso.php?page=Documentation

Once you have turned this into a .iso disk image you can either upgrade on your computer now or put it on a USB or DVD/CD. I recommend using this mounting tool called Rufus. It's
super easy to use. You can download it here -> https://rufus.ie/en_US/    <- The "How to use it guide" is already on there!

Once you're done with everything, go ahead and install and enjoy Windows 11! 

If you have any issues you stumble upon, don't hesitate to ask! Email me here -> vortexcomputersos@gmail.com

I plan to make version 2 easier to set up!

Edit (7/16/2021)

Off to plan 2! Looks like uploading the installer for Windows 11 didn't work. I'll be making a downloadable .RAR for you on my Google Drive; so you can easily download it without downloading the previous "un-working" file on GitHub. I'll update this Repository once I'm done!
