This project has been created so people that have older computers can run the new Windows 11 smoothly.

This is Version 2 of "W11_On_Unsupported_Hardware"

Ok so DO NOT download this file that is on here!

Download this .RAR! It has the re-programed .iso of Windows 11.

Then use a tool like Rufus to Extract the Files to USB
