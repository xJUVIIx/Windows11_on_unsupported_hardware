# Windows11_on_unsupported_hardware
This project has been created so people that have older computers can run the new Windows 11 smoothly.

This is Version 2 of "W11_On_Unsupported_Hardware"

Ok so DO NOT download this file that is on here!

Download this .RAR! It has the re-programed .iso of Windows 11. 

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1whog7AUA-BTQ-tuawhpf-rOmcCOTm3Su/view?usp=sharing

Then use a tool like Rufus to Extract the Files to USB

You can get that here -> https://rufus.ie/en_US/

Restart you Computer and load the files from your USB and enjoy Windows 11!

Okay.. I swear nothing seems to be working for this. GitHub currupts the .iso then the Google drive link doesn't want to work. So version 3 will consist another link for you guys to try.
It'll be a MEGA link. it will be downloadable! 

Version 3 will be out sometime tomorrow.
